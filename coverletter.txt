With my extensive background in low latency applications and passion for blockchain technology, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise to your dynamic team and play a pivotal role in shaping the future of crypto trading and finance at Kraken.

My passion for this space motivated me to write an arbitrage application back in 2018 purely as a personal project and personally made some money out of it. (https://github.com/garanaveen/arbitrage)

As a highly skilled software engineer with over 15+ of experience in C++, I have a proven track record of developing and implementing products that have consistently delivered superior results.

What sets me apart is my deep understanding of blockchain technology and its applications.

At Kraken, I am particularly drawn to your mission of accelerating the global adoption of crypto and your commitment to industry-leading security, crypto education, and client support. Your focus on innovation aligns perfectly with my passion for staying at the forefront of quantitative engineering and bringing fresh ideas to the table.

In my current role at Roku, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to drive results and deliver value. I am confident that my background and experience make me a strong fit for the Senior Quantitative Software Engineer role at Kraken.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and contributing to your continued success.

Sincerely,

Naveen Gara
